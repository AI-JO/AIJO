### description of project :
- Monitoring the quantities of fuel available at gas stations and the quantities of consumption and stock
Strategy by creating artificial intelligence software that predicts consumption amounts in
Different regions based on historical consumption figures. The software also estimates
Quantities of fuel in private stations that do not have sensors. And constructive
Based on these predictions, the software can guide stakeholders to provide a minimum
Strategic inventory at gas stations and proper fuel distribution

- Creating an AI software that predicts fuel consumption and estimates quantities of fuel in private stations without sensors requires a multi-step approach involving data collection, model training, and predictive analysis.:
 ### Data Collection and Preparation:
- a. Gather historical fuel consumption data from various gas stations in different regions.
- b. Collect data on factors that influence fuel consumption, such as population density, economic activity, weather patterns, and traffic conditions.
- c. Include data from private stations that have sensors to establish a benchmark for consumption estimation.
  
### Data Analysis and Feature Engineering :
- a. Analyze the collected data to identify patterns and correlations between consumption and influencing factors.
- b. Engineer features that capture the effects of different variables on fuel consumption (e.g., population density, economic activity, historical consumption, etc.).
### Wireframing and Design:

Create wireframes and prototypes of the application's user interface (UI) and user experience (UX).
Design the UI elements, including layout, color scheme, fonts, and graphic

### Technology Stack Selection:
#### Frontend :
- HTML (HyperText Markup Language): The standard markup language for creating the structure of web pages.
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Used for styling and layout of web pages, enhancing the user interface.
- JavaScript: A versatile programming language that enables interactivity and dynamic content on the client-side.
- ##### Frontend Frameworks:

- React.js: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, maintained by Facebook.
- Angular: A comprehensive front-end framework maintained by Google, great for building complex, large-scale applications.
- Vue.js: A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces incrementally, often chosen for its simplicity and ease of integration.
  ##### CSS Frameworks:

- Bootstrap: A widely-used CSS framework for responsive and mobile-first web development.
- Material-UI: A popular CSS framework that implements Google's Material Design guidelines

#### Backend :
  - Node.js: An open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code on the server-side.
  - Python: A versatile and widely-used programming language with frameworks suitable for web development (e.g., Django, Flask).
  - Ruby: A dynamic, object-oriented programming language often used with the Ruby on Rails framework for rapid development.
  - Java: A popular and powerful object-oriented programming language, often used with frameworks like Spring and Hibernate.
   ##### Backend Frameworks:
  
  - Express.js: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that simplifies backend development.
  - Django: A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
  - Ruby on Rails: A web application framework written in Ruby, known for its simplicity and speed of development.
  - Spring: A powerful Java framework that simplifies enterprise Java development.
  ##### Database:
  
  - SQL (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite): Relational databases suitable for structured data and complex queries.
  - NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB, CouchDB): Non-relational databases suitable for handling large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data
  - Table: GasStations
