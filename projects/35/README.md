# About This Project 
- Emergency patient scheduling involves anticipating the time frame in which healthcare services will be provided to patients in the midst of congestion, existing medical conditions, 
  and the number of healthcare staff available on duty at the location. I'll explain this in a simpler manner:

  When there's a lot of people needing medical attention at the emergency room, scheduling becomes crucial. It's about deciding who gets treated first based on how sick they are and how   many medical staff are available. Here are the main steps:

  ####   Assessing the situation :
  Patients are evaluated based on how severe their health condition is and how urgently they need care.

  ####  Prioritization:
  Patients are given priority based on their health condition and how it affects their life. For instance, critical emergencies like shock or life-threatening situations are prioritized.

  ####  Estimating wait times:
  Using past data and knowledge of how long similar cases take, an estimate is made for when each patient is likely to receive care.
  
  ####  Updating and monitoring the list:
  The list is regularly updated to make sure patients remain in the same health condition as initially assessed and to monitor the expected time for care.
