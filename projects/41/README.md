# AI-based Water Consumption Analysis and Leakage Detection

## Overview
This project focuses on the development of an artificial intelligence system to analyze water consumption patterns and accurately detect leaks within geographic regions. The AI software predicts water wastage quantities, locations, and leak points, assisting maintenance teams in efficiently addressing the issues.

## Workflow


### Data Collection and Cleaning
- Employ data analysis tools like Python with libraries such as pandas and NumPy to gather and analyze data.
- Apply data cleaning techniques and statistical analysis to enhance data quality and accuracy.

### AI Model Training
- Utilize frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch for training the AI model.
- Preprocess the collected data, including cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering.
- Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate model performance.
- Implement various AI algorithms, such as Neural Networks, and choose the most suitable architecture.
- Train the model using appropriate loss functions and optimization algorithms, adjusting hyperparameters for optimal performance.
- Monitor the training process, visualize metrics, and make necessary adjustments to prevent overfitting and improve accuracy.
- Evaluate the trained model using unseen data to ensure generalization and effectiveness.

## Building the Analysis System

### Frontend Development:

- **Choose a Frontend Framework:**
  - Select a frontend framework like React, Angular, or Vue.js based on project requirements and your familiarity with the framework.

- **UI/UX Design:**
  - Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface to display the analyzed data, visualizations, and provide functionalities to interact with the system.

- **Implement the UI Components:**
  - Create components (e.g., charts, forms, data displays) that represent different parts of the system and its functionalities.

- **Manage State:**
  - Use state management libraries or patterns (e.g., Redux, Context API) to manage the application's state and ensure a consistent user experience.

- **Integrate with Backend APIs:**
  - Communicate with the backend APIs to fetch data and send user actions (e.g., predictions, queries) to the backend for processing.

- **Responsive Design:**
  - Ensure that the application is responsive and accessible on various devices and screen sizes.

### Backend Development:

- **Choose a Backend Framework:**
  - Use a suitable backend framework like Flask or Django in Python to handle HTTP requests and responses.

- **API Design:**
  - Define the APIs that the frontend will use to interact with the backend. This includes specifying endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication mechanisms.

- **Connect to the Database:**
  - Establish a connection to the chosen database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to store and retrieve data for the application.

- **Implement Authentication and Authorization:**
  - If needed, implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to certain parts of the application.

- **Integrate AI Model:**
  - Integrate the trained AI model into the backend to process requests from the frontend, provide predictions, and perform necessary data analysis.

- **Handle HTTP Requests:**
  - Implement logic to handle HTTP requests from the frontend, process data, and return appropriate responses.
